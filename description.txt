(This mod is currently heavily WIP, Do not expect things to work properly or at all)

The WarWolfWorks mod is now on! Currently, the plan for this mod is:
- JoJo Stands (w/Star Platinum, The World, Magician's Red, Killer Queen and Hierophant Green being the first/base additions)
- Infommi Weapons (of all characters except Metalgayzer for now), Vanity items and Bosses
- Open source! You can access all code, images and content directly by going to Mods>WarWolfWorks Mod>More Info>Extract
